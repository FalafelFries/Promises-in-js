# Promises-in-js
Illustration of Promises concept in Javascript

You can use node.js to run these scripts or maybe you can include them in your html document and view the result in the browser console.

I have implemented a series of asynchronous operations using using promises, which help in giving our code a desired execution behaviour.
Then I have shown how we can interact with those promises using then(method) and also a better way of implementing those promises using async and await keywords.
async and await keywords help in making asynchronous code look like synchronous, they are basically some syntactical sugar which can be very helpful in writing clean and readable code!

The order in which I will be suggesting you to go through these files is:
1. withoutPromises.js
2. withPromises.js
3. promisesUsingAsync-Await.js
