# Promises-in-js
Illustration of Promises concept in Javascript

You can use node.js to run these scripts or maybe you can include them in your html document and view the result in the browser console.

The order in which I will be suggesting you to go through these files is:
1. withoutPromises.js
2. withPromises.js
3. promisesUsingAsync-Await.js
